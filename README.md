# Carolyne-s-Creations_Adobe
For Carolyne's Creations’ website, I created five pages at Adobe Dreamweaver. It has a few links that navigate to kids’ class, adults’ class and a recipe page. This website has a logo, contact corner along with copyright info. I also added a form for interested people to fill out. For making it more dynamic, I put kids’ picture working in a kitchen and a video of a cook as well. Have a look and give me feedback!
